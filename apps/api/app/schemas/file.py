    StrEnum rather than Enum, matching IngestionRunStatus and CourseStatus. A
    plain Enum member is not a str, so FastAPI could not serialise a File row
    through FileRead -- whose `status` is a Literal of strings -- and every
    response raised ResponseValidationError:

        {'type': 'literal_error', 'loc': ('response', 'status'),
         'input': <FileStatus.UPLOADED: 'uploaded'>}

    Nothing had returned a FileRead before, so the mismatch had never been
    exercised. The database side is unaffected: values_callable already stores
    the lowercase value either way (R25).

    Upload and ingestion are separate endpoints, so a file that has been stored
    but not yet queued had no state to sit in and was being mislabelled
    `processing`. The ERD has carried four values since 27 Jul.
